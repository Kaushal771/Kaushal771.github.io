    <h3> 2. How did I password protect my page? </h3>
    <p> In order to password protect the main webpage I used a simple script I found online. The script prompts the user to enter the password.
        If the correct password is entered then they are granted access. If the password is not correct they are asked to input the correct password.

    <h3> 3. What new tag did I try? </h3>
    <p> The new tag which I decided to try for the lab was the img tag. I had never used the img tag before as the only time I used
        HTML prior to this lab was this summer when I was first learning it. During that time I was only introduced to the paragraph, body,
        and html tags. The effect was of using the img tag was that I now know how to place images on the webpages I want to create. Which adds
        a lot more visually to the page itself. I also now know how big the image can be by using the height and width properties of the img tag.
        Also if the image is not displayed I can add a small description of what is was supposed to be with the alt property.
